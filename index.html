            <h2>Initial Objective</h2>
            <p>The initial objective was to bring awareness to mental health issues in the United States. I wanted to bring attention to this topic as COVID-19 could have drastically affected people's mental health. </p>
            <p>This topic has significance to me because as a young adult adapting to the struggles of entering the "real world." Mental health issues seem to be a common occurrence among people around my age group. Thus I wanted to analyze the effects of COVID-19 on suicide rates.</p>

            <h2>Issues</h2>
            <p>However, as I was searching for my data, I realized that it was difficult to find data relating to suicides. From my searching, I was unable to find data for post-2020 and even less data for data restricted to new York.</p>
            <p>The dataset, the dataset that I gathered from the WHO, mentions that globally the availability and quality of data is poor. The reason for this is because "the sensitivity of suicide and the illegality of suicidal behavior in some countries it is likely that under-reporting and misclassification are greater problems for suicide than for most other causes of death."        </p>
            <p>Thus I had to shift my topic to be suicide rates in the United States before 2019. However, I managed to find some statistical documents on various websites, as well as CSVs from the World Health Organization. 
                Thankfully, after more research, I was able to find a dataset that provided suicide rates by boroughs at different Hospitals. Although this data might not be perfect, it does display data that is useful. However,
                But a lot of this data was unformatted or had unnecessary amounts data.

            <h2>Data Cleaning</h2>
            <p>As most of this data was not in a spreadsheet format, I had to clean my data by copying the data into a google doc and then using a document to CSV converter by spaces.</p>
            <p>In addition, there were many irrelevant data points in the spreadsheet thus I had to drop irrelevant columns to my objective. This can be done with simple pandas or manually by deleting data from the spreadsheet
