    <h2>Initial Objective</h2>
    <p>The initial objective was to bring awareness to mental health issues in the United States. I wanted to bring attention to this topic as COVID-19 could have drastically affected people's mental health. </p>
    <p>This topic has significance to me because as a young adult adapting to the struggles of entering the "real world." Mental health issues seem to be a common occurrence among people around my age group. Thus I wanted to analyze the effects of COVID-19 on suicide rates.</p>
